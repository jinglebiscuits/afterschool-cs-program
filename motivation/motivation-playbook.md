### Motivation Playbook (4th–5th Grade After‑School CS)

Audience: Two 60–75 min sections (Tue/Thu), 13 weeks, first‑time coders. Tools: p5.js via OpenProcessing Class; optional Python Turtle.

---

### Principles (no grades needed)
- **Autonomy**: Let kids choose themes (art, games, stories) and visual styles.
- **Mastery**: Design small, visible wins every session (a thing they can “ship”).
- **Purpose**: Share work weekly (mini‑demo) and publicly at end‑of‑semester showcase.

### Default class flow (70–75 min)
- 5 min — Bell ringer (typing or one‑prompt debug)
- 10–15 min — Micro‑lesson + live demo (one new idea)
- 30–40 min — Build time (pairs), teacher conferences
- 10 min — Boss fight (fun, time‑boxed challenge)
- 5–10 min — Show & celebrate + backup/cleanup

### Routines that drive motivation
- **Choice tracks**: Art with p5.js, Games with p5.js, or Stories with Python Turtle (alt). Students can switch during Weeks 3–5.
- **Visible progress**: Post a "Ship‑It Shelf" of links/screenshots; use small badges (Variables, Loops, Conditions, State, Randomness, Debug Detective).
- **Real audience**: Weekly 60–90s mini‑demos; mid‑semester share; Week 13 showcase.
- **Student jobs**: Tech Helper, Bug Buster, Demo Captain, Timekeeper. Rotate weekly.
- **Micro‑challenges**: 10–15 min themed prompts tied to the day’s concept.
- **Praise ratio**: Aim for 3:1 positive to corrective, specific to behavior/effort.

### Behavior without grades
- Set norms on Week 1; rehearse call‑and‑response for attention (e.g., "Eyes here in 3…2…1").
- Use choices (“Build at pair table A or B”) rather than public consequences.
- Keep correction private; keep praise public. Use proximity and light touch.

### Quick scripts you can say
- “Today’s goal: ship one tiny thing you can show.”
- “Pair roles: Driver types, Navigator thinks ahead. Switch on the timer.”
- “Stuck? Try: read the error, log a value, comment out code, ask your Navigator.”

### Week‑by‑week motivation accents (aligned to `syllabus-13-weeks.md`)
- **Week 1 — Algorithms are recipes**
  - Accent: Unplugged wins + stickers for clear, precise steps.
  - Ship: A 6–10 step algorithm card with a title and 1 emoji.

- **Week 2 — Data, rules, classification**
  - Accent: Team posters; each team signs the rules they shaped.
  - Ship: Paper prototype photo on the wall.

- **Week 3 — Draw the board (OpenProcessing)**
  - Accent: First digital win; screenshot to Ship‑It Shelf.
  - Boss fight: Make 5 stars randomized on the canvas.
  - Ship: Sketch runs, 6–8 cities drawn; backup ZIP saved.

- **Week 4 — Model the map with data**
  - Accent: Data‑driven magic—change one number, many things move.
  - Boss fight: Add a new city by editing the array only.
  - Ship: Board renders from arrays/objects.

- **Week 5 — Turns and game state**
  - Accent: You control the rules; UI shows whose turn.
  - Boss fight: Add a highlight around current player.
  - Ship: End‑turn works; HUD updates.

- **Week 6 — Cards and claiming routes**
  - Accent: Chance + choice; celebrate first claims.
  - Boss fight: Implement a tiny deck and draw two cards.
  - Ship: Claim rule works on at least 2 routes.

- **Week 7 — Scoring and goals**
  - Accent: Scores visible; simple objectives.
  - Boss fight: Add score by route length; display live.
  - Ship: Playable loop with a basic win condition.

- **Week 8 — Polish and playtesting**
  - Accent: Feedback turns good into great.
  - Boss fight: Add a start screen or a clear error message.
  - Ship: Feature‑complete v1 + playtest notes.

- **Week 9–10 — Option A: AI mini‑unit (or continue features)**
  - Accent: Curiosity; connect to fairness and data.
  - Boss fights: Pose → action mini‑demo; or add animations.
  - Ship: Small prototype or feature uplift.

- **Week 11 — Final features and QA**
  - Accent: Quality pride; bug count down.
  - Boss fight: Fix a bug and write a 1‑line test note.
  - Ship: Release candidate; freeze features.

- **Week 12 — Showcase prep**
  - Accent: Storytelling; practice demo scripts.
  - Boss fight: 60–90s demo dry run.
  - Ship: Screenshot, rule card, demo script printed.

- **Week 13 — Community showcase**
  - Accent: You’re creators; gratitude and reflection.
  - Boss fight: N/A; focus on hosting.
  - Ship: Final demo + reflection card.

### Mini‑conference checklist (during build time)
- Ask: “What did you try? What happened? What will you try next?”
- Observe pair roles and rotate if needed.
- Record a quick note: concept grasp (✅/➖/⬜), blocker, next step.

### Lightweight tracking without grades
- Post a badge chart (stickers or initials) for concepts: Variables, Loops, Conditions, Functions, Arrays/Objects, State, Randomness, Debugging, Playtesting.
- Keep a per‑section checklist of weekly ships (Tue/Thu) to equalize pacing.

### Movement breaks (60–90s)
- “If mouseIsPressed = freeze” mime.
- Stand‑up stretch, then 3 deep breaths with eyes on a far object.

### Materials to print
- Badge sheet, Ship‑It Checklist, Student Job Cards, Demo Script Template. See dedicated files in this repo.
