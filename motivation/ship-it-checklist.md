### Ship‑It Checklist (End of Class, 3–5 minutes)

Goal: Every student leaves with proof of progress and a way to recover next week.

For students (projected on screen)
1) Save in editor (OpenProcessing auto‑saves, still click Save)
2) Take a screenshot (board visible + HUD) and drop it in the class folder
3) Create a ZIP backup (More → Download) and upload to class folder/USB
4) Rename files clearly: `TUE-05_AlexR-JordanM_wk0X.*`
5) Write one line in notes: “Today we shipped … Next time we’ll …”

For teacher
- Start a 4‑minute timer and announce steps 1–5
- Walk the room with a USB (if using USB backup)
- Verify 3 random teams completed the ZIP; spot‑check naming
- Add 2 shout‑outs for visible progress or teamwork

Recovery tip
- If anything goes missing next week, re‑import last week’s ZIP and continue.
