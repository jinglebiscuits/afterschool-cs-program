### Boss Fight Challenges (10–15 min time‑boxed)

Use one per week to energize and reinforce the day’s concept. Celebrate attempts, not just completions. Encourage pair roles: Navigator explains, Driver codes.

- **Week 1 — Algorithms**: Write a 6–8 step algorithm to teach a robot to draw a house with door and window. Bonus: add a loop shorthand for repeated steps.

- **Week 2 — Data & Rules**: On paper, list 5 data items and 3 rules your board game needs. Trade lists with another pair; can they play by your rules?

- **Week 3 — Drawing & Randomness (p5.js)**: Draw 10 stars at random positions and sizes. Bonus: change background when mouse is pressed.

- **Week 4 — Data‑driven Rendering**: Add one new city to `cities` and one route to `routes`. Do not hardcode any extra drawing. Bonus: color cities by type field.

- **Week 5 — State & Turns**: Add a visible border around the current player’s info. Bonus: add a simple state label ("selecting", "claiming").

- **Week 6 — Collections & Conditions**: Implement a 6‑card deck (array). On click, draw 1 card to a `hand` (array). Bonus: limit hand to 3 cards.

- **Week 7 — Scoring**: Add score equal to route `length` when claimed and display live totals. Bonus: show a trophy next to the leader.

- **Week 8 — Polish & Feedback**: Add a start screen with a "Play" button. Bonus: show an error message if a player tries to claim an owned route.

- **Week 9 — AI Option**: In Teachable Machine, train two poses; map them to two colors in p5.js and press a key to switch. Bonus: fairness talk—what happens with poor lighting?

- **Week 10 — AI Option**: Use the webcam pose to trigger a particle burst in p5.js. Bonus: add a threshold to avoid flicker.

- **Week 11 — QA**: Find and fix one bug; write a one‑line note of the cause and the fix. Bonus: add a simple guard clause.

- **Week 12 — Showcase Prep**: Time a 60–90s demo; include the game goal, one feature you’re proud of, and what you’d add next. Bonus: invite a neighbor to role‑play a parent.

- **Week 13 — Showcase**: N/A — host and celebrate.

Tips
