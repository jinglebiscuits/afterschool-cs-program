### Raffle Ticket System (Positive Reinforcement)

Purpose: Add light, fair, and fun motivation without grades. Every student starts with a win; extra tickets reinforce positive habits. One quick drawing ends class on a high note.

---

### Supplies
- Roll of numbered raffle tickets (keep the matching stub roll with you)
- Small container/jar for tickets (per section: Tue jar, Thu jar)
- Prize box (desktop eraser characters)
- Optional: sticker sheet to mark “earned” on notebooks; clipboard tracker

### Default rules (per class session)
- Everyone receives **1 entry ticket at the door**.
- Students can **earn extra tickets** for specific positive behaviors.
- Tickets can be **removed** sparingly for behavior after a private warning.
- **End-of-class drawing**: draw 1 ticket; winner chooses 1 prize.
- Tickets **reset each class** (do not carry over). Option: keep 1 ticket for a mid-semester mega-draw.
- No trading/selling tickets. Keep tickets visible on desks.

### When to award tickets (examples)
- **Ready to learn** in ≤60s (device open, editor up, bell ringer started)
- **Helped a peer** (tech sign-in, debugging suggestion, kindness)
- **Shipped** the day’s goal (completed `Ship‑It Checklist` steps)
- **Debug Detective** moment (read error, tested hypothesis, fixed)
- **Focus bounce-back** (redirected self after reminder; returned to task)

Cap: Aim for 0–3 extra tickets per student per day. Keep the **praise-to-removal ratio ≥ 3:1**.

### When to remove a ticket (sparingly)
- After a private warning, continued off‑task behavior that disrupts learning
- Disrespectful language/actions; unsafe use of equipment

Removal script (private): “I’m taking one ticket because ________. You can earn it back by ________. I want you in the drawing.”

Earn‑back option (recommended): If behavior improves for 5–10 minutes, return the ticket.

### Flow by time block
- **Arrival (0–5 min)**
  - Greet, hand 1 ticket, point to bell ringer.
  - Script: “Here’s your entry ticket. Start the bell ringer; you can earn more.”

- **Build time (core of class)**
  - Circulate with tickets in pocket and clipboard.
  - Award immediately with specific praise: “Ticket for helping Jordan read that error.”
  - If needed, use private redirect → remove only if behavior persists.

- **Ship‑It (last 3–5 min)**
  - Verify save, screenshot, ZIP. Award 1 ticket per pair that completes all steps.

- **Drawing (last 1–2 min)**
  - Mix jar; Timekeeper calls “3…2…1…”. Read number aloud; winner picks a prize.
  - If winner absent or can’t produce the matching stub, redraw.

### Fairness & guardrails
- Keep removals private; keep praise public.
- Use consistent award reasons; avoid favoritism. Aim to catch every student doing something right.
- If a student wins repeatedly, celebrate but continue random drawing (probability is part of the fun). Option: “win‑cooldown” of one week if needed.
- If a student has zero tickets at drawing time, invite an earn‑back task (quick room job) so they re‑enter the drawing.

### Roles that help
- **Timekeeper**: runs 60–90s timers and announces drawing.
- **Demo Captain**: leads applause for the winner; reminds about clean‑up.
