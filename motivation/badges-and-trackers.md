### Badges & Trackers (Motivation without Grades)

How to use
- Print a class badge chart and give pairs a sticker/initial when they demonstrate the concept in their own code.
- Keep it light and celebratory; badges mark milestones, not competition.

Badge set (award when demonstrated in the project)
- **Variables**: Stores and updates a value (e.g., score)
- **Loops**: Uses `for` or `while` to draw or update many items
- **Conditions**: Uses `if/else` to make a rule
- **Functions**: Extracts a named function that is called from `draw()` or events
- **Arrays/Objects**: Renders from `cities`/`routes` data structures (not hardcoded)
- **State**: Tracks current player or phase (e.g., `currentPlayer`, `phase`)
- **Randomness**: Uses `random()` for variation (stars, cards)
- **Debug Detective**: Fixes a bug using prints or reasoning (explain the cause)
- **Playtester**: Gives actionable feedback and iterates based on it

Class tracker (projected or printed)
| Pair | Variables | Loops | Conditions | Functions | Arrays/Objects | State | Random | Debug | Playtest |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TUE‑01 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| TUE‑02 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| THU‑01 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| THU‑02 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Individual mini‑tracker (quarter‑sheet printable)

Tips
- Award badges during the last 10 minutes while circulating.
- Praise the underlying practice ("You tested a hypothesis") not just the outcome.
