### OpenProcessing Class: Join & Save (No Emails)

Use this for the p5.js track. Students join your class and save sketches without needing email.

- **Class link**: [OpenProcessing Class](https://openprocessing.org/class/101362#/)
- **When to use**: Every coding week (Weeks 3–8, 9–13)

### Student join options

Choose one approach based on your class settings and school policy. Either avoids email.

1) Teacher-created usernames
- Pre-create student accounts in your class (or import from a roster if supported).
- Give each student a small credential card with: Section (Tue/Thu), Display Name, Username, Passcode.
- Students sign in at the class link and see only the class sketches.

2) Join with class link and nickname
- Share the class link above via QR/short URL.
- Students choose a school-safe nickname (first name + last initial) and a simple passcode.
- If prompted to create an account, use the no-email option or continue as a class-managed student (per class settings).

Tip: Keep a printed roster sheet with the exact nickname/passcode pairs in case of forgotten credentials.

### First-day setup (5 minutes)

1. Open the class link on the projector.
2. Students join/sign in using the chosen method.
3. Each pair creates a new sketch in the class.
4. Name it using this convention: `TUE-05_AlexR-JordanM_wk03` or `THU-03_SamP-KaiL_wk03`.
5. Paste the starter from `p5js-starter.md` into `sketch.js`, then Run.

### Saving work during class

- OpenProcessing auto-saves frequently. Also press Save before transitions.
- Keep one sketch per pair per week. Create a new sketch the following week with the updated suffix (`_wk04`, etc.).
- If students need to branch, use Duplicate within the class and add `-v2`.

### End-of-class backup (2 minutes)

Have every team produce a portable backup each session.

Option A — Shared drive
- Click More (⋯) → Download (ZIP) on the sketch.
- Save to the shared class folder using the same naming convention: `Class_Shared/TUE/05/wk03/TUE-05_AlexR-JordanM_wk03.zip`.

Option B — Teacher USB
- Download (ZIP) to desktop, then copy to a teacher USB organized by section/week.

Option C — Upload to the class LMS
- If the school uses Google Classroom/Clever/ClassLink with drive storage, upload the ZIP to the week’s assignment.

Weekly habit: Do the backup in the last 3–4 minutes as part of cleanup. This protects against device resets or login hiccups.

### Recovery and carryover

- If a device wipes local state or a student forgets a passcode, open the ZIP from last week and re-upload/import into a new sketch.
- Keep at least the two most recent weeks of ZIPs.

### Teacher quick checklist

- Post the class link and a QR code at the front of the room.
- Bring printed credential cards (or nickname/passcode list) and a few spares.
- Verify the network allows `openprocessing.org`.
- Practice Download (ZIP) once so students see where files land on the device.
