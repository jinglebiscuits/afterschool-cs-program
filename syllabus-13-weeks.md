### Intro CS After-School Syllabus (13 weeks)

Audience: 4th–5th grade beginners (two sections). One 60–75 min session per week.

Teaching approach: Hands-on, concrete-first. Weeks 1–2 unplugged; Weeks 3–8 build a simplified board game in JavaScript with p5.js (recommended) or Python Turtle (alt). Weeks 9–10 are an optional AI mini‑unit; otherwise continue features/polish. Weeks 11–13 finalize and showcase.

Tech pick (recommended): JavaScript + p5.js via OpenProcessing Class (no emails). Alt: p5.js Web Editor or Python + Turtle in Trinket/Replit. Class link: https://openprocessing.org/class/101362#/

Routine: Each week starts with a 5‑minute typing bell‑ringer (Monkeytype or fallback) to build keyboard fluency.

Week 1 — Algorithms are recipes
- Big idea: Computers follow precise steps we design.
- Activities: Unplugged "sandwich bot"; direction-giving; error-finding; class norms.
- Outcome: Students write a 6–10 step algorithm with clear sequencing.

Week 2 — Data, rules, and classification
- Big idea: Rules and data make a game work.
- Activities: Good‑Monkey/Bad‑Monkey classification; paper‑prototype "Routes & Rails Jr" (simplified Ticket to Ride) with index cards.
- Outcome: Shared game rules and components list.

Week 3 — From paper to screen: draw the board
- Big idea: Coordinate systems and sprites.
- Activities: OpenProcessing class sign-in and p5.js setup; draw cities as circles and routes as lines; handle mouse clicks.
- Outcome: Starter sketch showing 6–8 cities and a few routes; click highlights.

Week 4 — Model the map with data
- Big idea: Programs use data structures to drive visuals.
- Activities: Represent cities and routes as arrays/objects; render dynamically from data.
- Outcome: Board renders entirely from a data model.

Week 5 — Turns and game state
- Big idea: State machines control whose turn and what actions are allowed.
- Activities: Implement turn order, current player indicator, simple HUD.
- Outcome: Players can end turn; UI shows whose turn it is.

Week 6 — Cards and claiming routes
- Big idea: Collections, randomness, conditions.
- Activities: Implement a small deck of colored cards; draw cards; if color match and route free, claim it.
- Outcome: Players can draw and claim short routes; route shows ownership color.

Week 7 — Scoring and simple goals
- Big idea: Variables accumulate scores; rules resolve endgame.
- Activities: Per‑route scoring; optional "destination" mini‑goals (2–3 only); end when deck empty or N routes claimed.
- Outcome: Complete playable loop; basic win condition.

Week 8 — Polish and playtesting
- Big idea: Feedback and iteration improve usability.
- Activities: Add start screen, clear buttons, error messages; fix bugs; in‑class playtest with checklists.
- Outcome: Feature‑complete v1.

Week 9 — Option A: AI Mini‑Unit I (or continue features)
- AI path: Code.org "AI for Oceans" + discussion of bias; connect to training data and fairness.
- Game path: Add route costs of length 2–3, card limits, simple animations/sounds.

Week 10 — Option A: AI Mini‑Unit II (or continue features)
- AI path: Teachable Machine (poses) + controlled demo; optionally map a "raise hand" pose to a p5.js action.
- Game path: Add destination tickets UI, basic save/load, or accessibility tweaks.

Week 11 — Final features and QA
- Activities: Freeze new features; fix defects; add instructions modal; polish visuals.
- Outcome: Stable release candidate.

Week 12 — Showcase prep
- Activities: Peer review; prepare short demo scripts; make printed rule cards and screenshots.
- Outcome: Ready for families/teachers.

Week 13 — Community showcase
- Activities: Rotations to play each team’s game; reflection circle on what we learned.
- Outcome: Students present as creators.

Notes for two sections (Tue/Thu)
- Teach identical content both days; keep a simple checklist of completed items per section.
- If one section advances faster, use Week 9–10 for enrichment while the other catches up.

Assessment and inclusion
- Success markers: Can explain an algorithm; can identify state; can add a new city/route in data; can test and debug a rule.
- Pair programming rotates weekly; roles: Driver/Navigator. Offer printed code snippets for students who need extra scaffolding.

Materials
- Index cards, markers, colored paper strips (for paper routes), dot stickers (cities), printed playtest checklists.
- Laptops/desktops with modern browser; projector.
- Typing site access (Monkeytype/TypingClub/Keybr/Nitro Type).

Safety and privacy
- If using webcams in Week 10, use in‑class only and avoid uploads; get parent consent in advance.
