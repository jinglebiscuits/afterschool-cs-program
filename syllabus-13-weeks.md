### Intro CS After-School Syllabus (13 weeks)

Audience: 4th–5th grade beginners (two sections). One ~60 min session per week.

Teaching approach: Hands-on, concrete-first. Weeks 1–3 shared core in JavaScript with p5.js. From Week 4 students choose a Game or Art track while we still work together on the same core concepts. Weeks 9–10 are an optional AI mini‑unit; otherwise continue features/polish. Weeks 11–13 finalize and showcase.

Tech pick: JavaScript + p5.js via OpenProcessing Class (no emails). Fallback: p5.js Web Editor. Join link: see `local/openprocessing-join-url.txt`.

Routine: Each week starts with a 5‑minute typing bell‑ringer (Monkeytype or fallback) to build keyboard fluency.

Week 1 — Algorithms are recipes
- Class rules (raffle tickets, laniards)
- Cartesian coordinates
- Canvas coordinates
- How to draw a circle in the middle of the screen

Week 2 — Data, rules, and classification
- Big idea: Rules and data make programs behave.
- Activities: Unplugged classification (features → labels), paper sketching of either a small game idea or an art composition; list inputs, outputs, and rules.
- Outcome: A one‑pager describing each pair’s idea using common vocabulary (sprites/shapes, state, events).

Week 3 — From paper to screen: shared core
- Big idea: Coordinate systems, shapes, input, and a simple state variable.
- Activities: OpenProcessing class sign‑in and p5.js setup; use `p5js-tracks-starter.md`. Draw shapes, text, and a button; handle mouse.
- Outcome: Starter sketch with: canvas, a button, and a variable that changes on click.

Week 4 — Branch to tracks (Game or Art)
- Big idea: Data structures drive what we draw and how it behaves.
- Activities: Choose a track. Represent your objects (player/targets OR shapes/patterns) as arrays/objects; render from data.
- Outcome: The sketch renders from a simple data model.

Week 5 — State and interaction
- Big idea: State variables and conditions control behavior.
- Activities: Game: movement and collision or scoring. Art: sliders/palette and animation time.
- Outcome: Visible interaction that changes state over time.

Week 6 — Collections and randomness
- Big idea: Arrays/objects, randomness, and simple rules.
- Activities: Game: spawn/collect targets or avoid obstacles. Art: pattern grids with noise/random.
- Outcome: Program uses arrays and randomness.

Week 7 — Goals and polish checkpoint
- Big idea: Define success and provide feedback.
- Activities: Game: score and win/lose condition. Art: export image or showcase mode with title.
- Outcome: Playable or displayable v1.

Week 8 — Polish and peer review
- Big idea: Feedback and iteration improve usability.
- Activities: Add instructions, clear buttons, fix bugs; peer review with checklists.
- Outcome: Feature‑complete v1.

Week 9 — Option A: AI Mini‑Unit I (or continue features)
- AI path: Code.org "AI for Oceans" + discussion of bias.
- Project path: Add stretch features, animations/sounds, or accessibility.

Week 10 — Option A: AI Mini‑Unit II (or continue features)
- AI path: Teachable Machine (poses) + controlled demo mapped to a p5.js action.
- Project path: Add simple save/load or additional UI.

Week 11 — Final features and QA
- Activities: Freeze new features; fix defects; add instructions modal; polish visuals.
- Outcome: Stable release candidate.

Week 12 — Showcase prep
- Activities: Peer review; prepare short demo scripts; make printed rule cards and screenshots.
- Outcome: Ready for families/teachers.

Week 13 — Community showcase
- Activities: Rotations to play each team’s game; reflection circle on what we learned.
- Outcome: Students present as creators.

Notes for two sections (Wed/Thu)
- Teach identical content both days; keep a simple checklist of completed items per section.
- If one section advances faster, use Week 9–10 for enrichment while the other catches up.

Assessment and inclusion
- Success markers: Can explain an algorithm; can identify state; can add items to an array/object and render from data; can test and debug a rule.
- Pair programming rotates weekly; roles: Driver/Navigator. Offer printed code snippets for students who need extra scaffolding.

Materials
- Index cards, markers, colored paper strips (for paper routes), dot stickers (cities), printed playtest checklists.
- Laptops/desktops with modern browser; projector.
- Typing site access (Monkeytype/TypingClub/Keybr/Nitro Type).

Safety and privacy
- If using webcams in Week 10, use in‑class only and avoid uploads; get parent consent in advance.
