 I have volunteered to develop and teach an afterschool program for a local elementary school made available to fourth and fifth graders. My background and teaching computer science is with high school classes through the Microsoft teals program. This program used a visual programming language similar to scratch. I don't necessarily wanna stick to a visual programming language, even though it is a class for young first time CS students. I would rather make the focus something that they are interested in. We will standardize on JavaScript with p5.js in OpenProcessing.

 The class will have two sections; one that meets on Wednesdays and one that meets on Thursdays.

 the class will be taught per semester so I will teach the same class in the fall and then the same class in the spring.
 There will be around 13 weeks where I will teach the class. We will work together on shared core lessons and then allow students to choose a track: a small game of their choice or a generative art project. The class will move mostly in sync so students can support each other while personalizing their projects.
