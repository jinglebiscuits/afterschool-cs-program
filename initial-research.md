A Developmentally-Informed Framework for an After-School Computer Science Program for 4th and 5th GradersPrepared for: After-School Program Director, Birmingham, AlabamaSubject: Program Design for Elementary Computer Science, with Special Consideration for Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs), and ChatbotsSection 1: The Cognitive Landscape of the 4th and 5th Grader: A Foundation in Concrete OperationsTo design an effective and meaningful computer science program for 4th and 5th-grade students, it is imperative to first establish a clear understanding of their cognitive capabilities. The success of any curriculum is contingent not on the sophistication of its content, but on its alignment with the developmental stage of its learners. For students aged approximately 9 to 11, this stage is predominantly the Concrete Operational Stage, a concept central to the developmental theory of psychologist Jean Piaget.1 This framework reveals that a child's intelligence differs from an adult's in quality, not merely in quantity, and that children are active builders of their own knowledge.1Defining the Concrete Operational Stage (Ages 7-11)The hallmark of the concrete operational stage is the emergence of logical thought. Students in this phase are no longer governed purely by perception; they can use mental operations and a set of logical rules to understand the world around them.1 Key developments include:Logical Reasoning about Concrete Events: Children can think logically with much greater success when they can manipulate or visualize real, tangible materials.1 Their problem-solving skills are most potent when applied to physical objects or events they have experienced.Conservation: They grasp the concept that a quantity remains the same despite changes in its appearance. For example, they understand that a quantity of liquid is the same whether it is in a tall, thin glass or a short, wide one.1Decentering and Perspective-Taking: Egocentrism diminishes significantly. Children become capable of considering others' thoughts and feelings, understanding that different people have different perspectives.2 This development is crucial for collaboration and empathy.Classification and Seriation: They develop the ability to group objects based on shared characteristics and to order items along a quantitative dimension, such as size or length.1However, the critical limitation of this stage is a pronounced difficulty with purely abstract or hypothetical reasoning.1 Students are often overwhelmed or make mistakes when asked to reason about concepts that have no physical or visual referent. The stage is named "concrete" precisely because their logical abilities are tethered to the concrete world.The Emerging Bridge to Formal Operations (Ages 11+)It is important to recognize that many 5th graders, at age 11, are on the cusp of Piaget's next stage: the Formal Operational Stage.2 During this transition, the capacity for abstract thought begins to emerge. Students start to think hypothetically, consider multiple possibilities, and reason about abstract concepts like justice or fairness.5 This means that while the program's foundation must be concrete, it can and should build gentle bridges toward more abstract ideas, preparing students for the next phase of their cognitive development.A fundamental principle must therefore guide the design of this entire program: the imperative to make abstract concepts concrete. Core computer science topics—algorithms, data, variables, bias, and especially the mechanisms of artificial intelligence—are inherently abstract. A direct pedagogical collision exists between this subject matter and the predominant cognitive style of 9-to-11-year-olds. The central challenge, and the key to success, is to build "cognitive bridges" that allow students to physically or visually manipulate, interact with, and experience these abstract ideas in a tangible way. An "algorithm" cannot be introduced as a formal definition; it must first be experienced as a recipe for making a sandwich or the rules for a game.7 Failure to make this translation will lead to rote memorization at best and disengagement at worst.Furthermore, the curriculum can leverage a key cognitive skill that students have already been developing: symbolic thought. Piaget notes that a major achievement leading into this stage is the ability to make one thing, such as a word or an object, stand for something else.1 This is the foundation of language and make-believe play. Large Language Models and all forms of programming are fundamentally systems of symbolic representation. Code blocks, lines of text, and user inputs are all symbols that represent complex operations. By explicitly framing coding in this way, the curriculum connects to a familiar cognitive process. A block in the Scratch programming environment is not just a colorful shape; it is a powerful symbol that makes something happen. This approach makes the new material feel less alien and more like a natural extension of a skill they already possess.Section 2: A Scaffolded Curriculum: From Unplugged Logic to Block-Based CreationGiven the cognitive landscape of 4th and 5th graders, the curriculum must be carefully scaffolded. It should begin with activities that are maximally concrete and low-stakes, gradually introducing layers of abstraction only after a solid foundation of understanding and confidence has been built. This approach ensures that all students, regardless of their prior experience with technology, can find an accessible entry point and feel a sense of mastery from the outset.6Phase 1: Unplugged Foundations - Thinking Like a ComputerThe program should dedicate its initial phase to "unplugged" activities—tasks that teach computational thinking without the use of a computer. This strategy serves a critical purpose as a "cognitive on-ramp." It removes the technical barrier of software and hardware, allowing students to focus purely on the logic and problem-solving processes that underpin all of computer science. These social, kinesthetic activities build a shared vocabulary and demystify the "magic" of computers by revealing that their operations are based on human-understandable rules and patterns.7Activity: Real-World Algorithms: Students begin by writing out precise, step-by-step instructions for everyday tasks, such as making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, tying a shoe, or navigating from the classroom to the library.7 The instructor can then "execute" these instructions literally, highlighting any ambiguities or missing steps. This exercise viscerally teaches the importance of sequencing, precision, and clarity in algorithms.Activity: The Good-Monkey-Bad-Monkey Game: This activity provides a perfect, tangible analogy for a machine learning classification model.8 Students are given a set of "training data" in the form of cards showing monkeys with various features (e.g., eye shape, mouth shape, color). Each card is labeled as either "biting" or "non-biting." Working in small groups, students must analyze the training cards to discover patterns and create a set of rules—a decision tree—that can predict whether a new, unseen monkey will bite. The teams then test their rules on a new set of "test data" cards. This single activity introduces the concepts of training data, testing data, feature recognition, and classification algorithms in a playful, collaborative, and entirely concrete way.Phase 2: Introduction to Block-Based Programming - ScratchAfter establishing these foundational concepts in a tangible, unplugged context, students are ready to transition to the computer. The ideal environment for this age group is a block-based programming language like Scratch, developed by MIT.11 Platforms like Scratch, Tynker, and Code.org's CS Fundamentals are highly recommended for several key reasons 12:Visual and Intuitive: Students drag and drop color-coded blocks that snap together like puzzle pieces. This visual interface lowers the cognitive load and makes the logic of the program flow apparent.Prevents Syntax Errors: The blocks are designed so that only syntactically correct combinations can be joined.11 This eliminates a major source of frustration for novice programmers, allowing them to focus on the logic and creativity of their project rather than on typos and punctuation.Immediate Feedback: As students build their code, they can instantly run it and see the results, whether it's a character moving across the screen or a score changing. This tight feedback loop is highly motivating and supports iterative problem-solving.During this phase, the focus should be on creation and play, aligning with the students' interest in planning, building, and storytelling.6 Initial projects can involve creating simple animations, interactive stories, or basic games like a maze or a pong clone.13 This allows them to apply concepts like loops, conditional statements (if-then), and variables in a context that is personally meaningful and fun.Section 3: Demystifying Artificial Intelligence: A Developmentally-Informed PathwayWith a solid foundation in computational logic and block-based programming, students are prepared to approach the topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is crucial to introduce AI not as a single, magical entity, but as a collection of specific tools and techniques designed by humans to solve particular problems. The pedagogical approach must continue to prioritize concrete interaction over abstract explanation.Subsection 3.1: Making Machine Learning TangibleThe most developmentally appropriate entry point into AI for this age group is through the concept of machine learning (ML), specifically supervised learning and classification. The key is to frame the students as the teachers of the machine, which empowers them and makes the process of "training a model" a concrete action they perform.Key Activity 1: Code.org's "AI for Oceans"This free, web-based activity is an exemplary tool for this age group and is designed for grades 3-12.12 In this activity, students are tasked with cleaning up the ocean by teaching an AI to distinguish between images of "fish" and "trash".16Cognitive Alignment: The abstract concept of providing training data becomes the concrete action of clicking a "Fish" or "Not Fish" button for a series of images. The abstract metric of model accuracy becomes the immediate, visible result of a cleaner ocean populated with sea creatures or a polluted one still full of trash. Students directly experience the relationship between the quality and quantity of their training data and the performance of the AI.17Integrated Ethics: The lesson brilliantly introduces the concept of bias. After the initial classification task, students are asked to train the AI on more subjective labels, such as "fun" or "angry" fish. They quickly realize that their personal opinions and biases are being directly encoded into the AI's model, leading to different results for different students.16 This provides a powerful, experiential foundation for later discussions on algorithmic fairness.Key Activity 2: Google's "Teachable Machine"Teachable Machine is another outstanding, free web tool that allows students to create their own ML models in minutes.19 Using their computer's webcam, they can train a model to recognize images, sounds, or body poses.Cognitive Alignment: This activity is even more concrete and personal than "AI for Oceans." Students use their own faces and bodies as the training data.22 They can train the model to distinguish between a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down, a happy face and a sad face, or leaning left versus leaning right. They receive real-time feedback as the model's "confidence score" for each category changes with their movements.22 This makes the abstract idea of probabilistic prediction visible and interactive.Integration with Scratch: Critically, the models created in Teachable Machine can be exported with a simple link and used to control a Scratch project.21 A student can train a model to recognize them tilting their head, and then use that model to control a character's movement in a game they build in Scratch. This creates a powerful, integrated capstone project for the machine learning module, directly connecting the AI concept to the programming skills they have already mastered.Subsection 3.2: The LLM and Chatbot Question: A Recommendation for Structured ExplorationThe question of whether to include lessons on Large Language Models (LLMs) and chatbots like ChatGPT is complex. These tools offer potential benefits, such as personalized tutoring and increased engagement.24 However, they also pose significant risks, especially for elementary-aged students. These risks include exposure to inaccurate or inappropriate information, the perpetuation of hidden biases, serious data privacy concerns, and the potential to stifle the development of critical thinking and writing skills.24 Furthermore, many of these services have terms of use that prohibit use by children under 13.31Therefore, the recommendation is a qualified yes to including lessons on LLMs and chatbots, but with a critical caveat: this must be done only through highly structured, teacher-facilitated, "sandboxed" activities. Open-ended, direct student access to commercial chatbot websites should be strictly prohibited.The goal of LLM education at this age is not to teach students how to become more proficient users of ChatGPT. Rather, the goal is to demystify the technology, inoculate them against its potential harms, and build foundational digital literacy. This can be achieved through a "Wizard of Oz" pedagogical approach, where the activities are designed to intentionally pull back the curtain and reveal the simple mechanisms and significant limitations behind the sophisticated facade.Key Activity 1: Build a Simple Chatbot in ScratchBefore interacting with a powerful commercial chatbot, students should first build their own. Using the conditional logic they have already learned in Scratch, they can program a character (a sprite) to ask a user questions and provide a series of pre-programmed answers based on keywords in the user's typed response.32 The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) includes a similar activity in its middle school summer camp.33 This experience is profoundly demystifying. It demonstrates that at its core, a chatbot is not a thinking entity but a program following a script of if-then rules—a script that they themselves can write.Key Activity 2: "The Great Debate" with a Controlled AIThis activity, adapted from Edutopia, frames the LLM as a tool for role-playing rather than an oracle of truth.34 The instructor chooses a topic, perhaps related to a social studies unit. A student is assigned a role (e.g., Thomas Jefferson). The instructor then, on a projected screen for the whole class to see, prompts an LLM with very specific instructions: "You are Alexander Hamilton. I am Thomas Jefferson. Let's debate the role of the federal government. You begin." The student then debates the AI. The focus of the lesson is not on the AI's answers, but on a group analysis of the interaction. The class can analyze the AI's arguments for persuasiveness, clarity, and, most importantly, factual accuracy and potential bias. This models how to engage with these tools critically and aligns with the students' emerging ability to consider different perspectives.3Key Activity 3: AI as a Creative SparkTo model a healthy and responsible use of generative AI in a creative context, the instructor can use an LLM to generate a single, interesting story prompt, such as, "No one believed that Leo's cat could talk—until it demanded pancakes at breakfast".34 The students' task is then to take that single sentence and write the rest of the story entirely on their own. This activity positions the AI as a tool to overcome a specific, minor hurdle (writer's block) but keeps the essential creative and critical work firmly in the hands of the student. It reinforces student agency and demonstrates that these tools should be used to augment, not replace, human creativity.Section 4: Navigating the Ethical Maze: A Practical Framework for Responsible AI EducationTeaching about AI necessitates teaching about the ethics of AI. For 4th and 5th graders, these ethical principles cannot remain abstract concepts; they must be woven into the hands-on activities of the curriculum itself. The goal is to foster a mindset of "ethics by design," where students begin to see that building fair, safe, and responsible technology is a core part of the creation process.The research identifies five key ethical pillars that must be addressed: Algorithmic Bias, Data Privacy, Accuracy & Misinformation, Responsible Use & Critical Thinking, and Access & Equity.29 The following framework operationalizes these pillars by linking each risk to a concrete activity in the proposed syllabus, providing developmentally appropriate language and discussion prompts.The Experiential Ethics Framework for Elementary AIEthical RiskDevelopmentally-Appropriate Explanation ("The Big Idea")Practical Program Safeguards & Linked ActivitiesAlgorithmic Bias 24"A computer only knows what you teach it. If you only show it examples of one thing, it might get confused or be unfair to other things."Activity: AI for Oceans - Subjective Training.17 After training the AI on "fish vs. trash," have students train it on "pretty fish vs. ugly fish." 

 Discussion Prompt: "Did everyone agree on what a 'pretty' fish was? What happened to the fish that your AI thought were 'ugly'? Is it fair that the AI learned your opinion? What could happen if an AI learned unfair opinions about people?"Data Privacy 24"When you put a picture or your words on the internet, who gets to see it? Where does it go? Your information is special and you should be in charge of it."Activity: Teachable Machine - Pose/Image Recognition.22 Use webcams to train a model with student faces or poses. 

 Discussion Prompt: "You just used your face to teach the computer. Where did that picture go? Who owns it? Should we let websites take our picture without asking? Let's create a 'Classroom Data Promise' about how we'll be safe online."Accuracy & Misinformation 24"AIs can make mistakes or even make things up! They are like a parrot that repeats things it has heard, but it doesn't always understand if they are true. Always be a detective and check the facts."Activity: The Great Debate.34 After the debate, fact-check one of the AI's claims as a group using a reliable source. 

 Discussion Prompt: "Was the AI right about everything? We found a mistake! Why do you think it made that mistake? This is called a 'hallucination.' Why is it important to not just copy-paste from a chatbot for your homework?"Responsible Use & Critical Thinking 28"AI is a tool, like a hammer. You can use it to build something amazing, or you can use it in a way that's not helpful. We want to be the smart builders, not let the tool do all our thinking for us."Activity: AI as a Creative Spark.34 Explicitly discuss the activity's structure. 

 Discussion Prompt: "Why did we only use the AI for the first sentence? What would have happened to our creativity and our story if we let the AI write the whole thing? Your brain is the most powerful computer in the room!"Access & Equity 29"Not everyone has the same computers or internet at home. It's important that great tools are available for everyone, not just some people. That's why programs like this one are so important."Program Design: Actively partner with local universities and museums (see Section 6). Avoid assigning homework that requires specific software or high-speed internet. 

 Discussion Prompt: "How would your life be different without a computer at home? How can we make sure everyone gets a chance to learn these cool skills?"This experiential approach transforms ethics from a list of abstract "don'ts" into a series of engaging design challenges. When students see firsthand that their biased training data creates a flawed result, they learn that building "good" AI requires thinking about fairness from the very beginning. This fosters a sense of agency and a proactive ethical stance, empowering them to think like responsible creators.Section 5: Proposed 12-Week After-School Program SyllabusThis comprehensive, modular syllabus integrates the cognitive principles, scaffolded curriculum, and ethical framework into a practical, week-by-week plan. It is designed to be flexible for an after-school setting and requires only an internet-connected computer lab.Module 1: Thinking Like a Computer (Weeks 1-2)Week 1: Unplugged Algorithms & ClassificationActivities: "Real-World Algorithms" (writing recipes, giving directions).7 "The Good-Monkey-Bad-Monkey" classification game.8The Big Idea: Computers follow simple, clear rules that we create. We can teach them to sort things into groups based on patterns.Week 2: Introduction to Scratch & Symbolic PowerActivities: Students get familiar with the Scratch interface, sprites, the stage, and basic motion blocks. They create a simple "About Me" animation where a sprite introduces them.The Big Idea: We can use code blocks as powerful symbols to give instructions to the computer and make things happen on the screen.11Module 2: Building Our Own Worlds (Weeks 3-5)Week 3: Game Design FundamentalsActivities: Learn about loops (repeat blocks), conditionals (if-then blocks), and variables (scorekeeping). Students begin building a simple maze or pong-style game.14The Big Idea: We can use logic and variables to create rules and keep score in our own interactive games.Week 4: Creative Storytelling with CodeActivities: Students use their Scratch skills to create an interactive story or cartoon with multiple characters, dialogue (say blocks), and scene changes (backdrop changes).The Big Idea: Code is not just for games and math; it is a powerful tool for creative expression and telling our own stories.Week 5: Project Showcase & Collaborative FeedbackActivities: Students finalize their game or story projects. They present their work to the group and practice giving and receiving constructive feedback.The Big Idea: Sharing our work and learning from others helps us become better creators.Module 3: Teaching the Machine (Weeks 6-9)Week 6: What is AI? Training a ModelActivities: Introduction to AI concepts. Students complete the Code.org "AI for Oceans" activity, training the model to classify fish vs. trash.16The Big Idea: We can "teach" a computer to recognize patterns by giving it lots of examples, which is called training data.Week 7: Bias in, Bias OutActivities: Students revisit "AI for Oceans" but train the model on subjective data ("pretty" vs. "ugly" fish).17 This is followed by a guided discussion on Algorithmic Bias using the Experiential Ethics Framework.The Big Idea: AI is only as smart or as fair as the data we give it. Unfair data can teach an AI to be unfair.Week 8: Teaching with Our Bodies & Data PrivacyActivities: Introduction to Google's Teachable Machine.22 Students use their webcams to train a model to recognize their own poses (e.g., thumbs up/down). This is followed by a guided discussion on Data Privacy.The Big Idea: Our movements, faces, and voices can be used as data to teach a computer. We need to be careful about who we share our data with.Week 9: Connecting AI to Our CodeActivities: Students export their Teachable Machine model and use it as a controller for a new or existing Scratch project.21 For example, they can make a character jump when they raise their hand in front of the camera.The Big Idea: We can combine AI tools with our own code to create new and amazing things.Module 4: Understanding Chatbots & Our Future (Weeks 10-12)Week 10: How Do Chatbots Work?Activities: Using Scratch, students build their own simple, rules-based chatbot that can respond to a few keywords.32The Big Idea: Many chatbots aren't "thinking"; they are just following a script of if-then rules that a programmer wrote.Week 11: AI as a Tool, Not an OracleActivities: The instructor facilitates a structured activity like "The Great Debate" or "AI as a Creative Spark".34 This is followed by a guided discussion on Accuracy, Misinformation, and Responsible Use.The Big Idea: AI can be a useful tool to help us, but it can make mistakes and can't do our thinking for us. Our brains are the most important tool.Week 12: Final Project & Community ShowcaseActivities: Students combine their skills from all modules to create a final capstone project. The program culminates in a showcase where students demonstrate their projects to parents, teachers, and community partners. A final discussion on Access and Equity in technology takes place.The Big Idea: We are now computer scientists and creators who can use technology to build, create, and solve problems.Section 6: Activating the Birmingham STEM Ecosystem: A Guide to Local PartnershipsTo ensure the long-term success and sustainability of this after-school program, it is vital to connect it to the rich ecosystem of STEM education resources within Birmingham. These partnerships can provide expert guest speakers, hands-on materials, and a tangible pathway for students from an inner-city school into the broader world of science and technology. The key to building these relationships is to frame them as mutually beneficial collaborations rather than simple requests for aid.Tier 1: Immediate Engagement (First Semester)Partner: McWane Science CenterDescription: The McWane Science Center is a premier local resource for hands-on science education and offers numerous programs that can support this initiative.37Action: Contact the McWane Education Department at (205) 714-8300.Proposed Partnership: Inquire about borrowing their "STEM learning kits," which include materials and lesson plans that could complement the unplugged activities.37 Additionally, ask about scheduling a visit from their "McWane on the Move" outreach program to provide an exciting science demonstration to kick off or supplement the club's activities.37Partner: University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Department of Computer ScienceDescription: The UAB CS department, and specifically Professor Jeff Gray, has a long history of K-12 outreach in Alabama.33Action: Contact Professor Jeff Gray directly via email (gray@cis.uab.edu) or the department's outreach coordinators.Proposed Partnership: Reference Professor Gray's established K-12 "roadshow".39 Propose that he or one of his graduate students visit the after-school club as a guest speaker. A demonstration of robotics or a talk about the exciting careers available in computing can provide powerful, real-world context and inspiration for the students.Tier 2: Deeper Integration (Second Semester / Year 2)Partner: UAB Department of Computer ScienceDescription: Building on the initial guest speaker relationship, a more formal mentorship program can be established.Action: Contact the department's undergraduate program director or outreach coordinator.Proposed Partnership: Frame a proposal where UAB undergraduate computer science students can volunteer as regular mentors or co-teachers for the after-school program. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement: the club members receive expert, near-peer guidance, and the UAB students gain valuable teaching, communication, and community service experience that strengthens their resumes and fulfills departmental outreach goals.39Tier 3: Long-Term Pathway (Ongoing)Partner: UAB Summer CampsDescription: The UAB CS department hosts annual summer camps for middle and high school students, with topics including Scratch, Python, AI, and chatbots.33Action: Develop a relationship with the summer camp organizers.Proposed Partnership: Work to establish a direct pipeline for graduates of the after-school program to attend these summer camps. This creates a clear "next step" for interested students. Crucially, address the issue of access and equity 29 by collaborating with the university and local businesses to secure grant funding or sponsorships to cover the registration fees for students from the program, ensuring that financial constraints do not prevent them from pursuing their interests.Partner: Auburn University College of EngineeringDescription: While located further away, Auburn has extensive and well-organized K-12 outreach programs, including virtual options.41Action: Contact the Auburn Engineering K-12 Outreach office (futureengineer@eng.auburn.edu).43Proposed Partnership: Inquire about scheduling a free virtual field trip, where an Auburn outreach team member can lead a hands-on activity remotely for the club.41 Additionally, encourage students to join the free "Future Auburn Engineers Club" for K-8th graders, which provides monthly at-home activities and connects them to the broader engineering community in the state.42By strategically engaging these local and state-level partners, the after-school program can transform from an isolated club into a vital node in Birmingham's STEM education ecosystem, providing its students with invaluable resources, mentorship, and opportunities for years to come.
