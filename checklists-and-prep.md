### Instructor Prep and Checklists

Quick picks
- Language: JavaScript + p5.js on OpenProcessing Class (`https://openprocessing.org/class/101362#/`)
- Backup: Python Turtle via Trinket/Replit if OpenProcessing/p5.js is blocked
- Storage: Keep each team’s code in separate class sketches (named Section-Week-Team)

Accounts and access
- Verify lab network allows `openprocessing.org` (and `editor.p5js.org` as fallback) and allows downloads of ZIP files.
- Create/prepare your OpenProcessing Class; print join instructions or credential cards (see `openprocessing-join-instructions.md`).
- Prepare a no‑login plan: starter files downloadable via QR code or short URL.
- Allowlist typing sites (`https://monkeytype.com/`, `https://www.typingclub.com/`, `https://www.keybr.com/`, `https://www.nitrotype.com/`).
  - I like the typingclub, but I'm not sure if the videos will be easy for us to use. Something that doesn't require any audio and is self driven could be better.

Hardware and room
- Projector, whiteboard, sticky notes, index cards, markers.
- Headphones optional for sound polish weeks.

Class structure (each week, 60–75 min)
- 5 min: Typing bell‑ringer (Monkeytype or fallback), then quick recap.
- 10–15 min: Mini‑lesson + live demo.
- 30–40 min: Build time in pairs (Driver/Navigator switch at halfway).
- 5–10 min: Playtest/share + exit ticket.

Pairing logistics
- Make stable pairs for 2–3 weeks; rotate roles weekly.
- Provide "role cards" explaining Driver/Navigator responsibilities.

Typing bell‑ringer routine
- Default: Monkeytype (`https://monkeytype.com/`).
- Time: 2–3 min sprints Weeks 1–2; then 5 min max once/week.
- Settings (suggested): Time 30s or 60s; Words mode; punctuation off; numbers off; lowercase only; key hints on; confidence mode off.
- Flow: Post QR/short URL on screen; students start immediately upon arrival; teacher circulates.
- Fallbacks: TypingClub, Keybr, Nitro Type, or offline printed drills.

Behavior and pacing supports
- Use "must/could/extension" task tiers for mixed readiness.
- Printed snippet sheets for common tasks (draw city, add route, claim route).
- Visual timers; celebrate small wins.

Consent and safety (AI weeks)
- Send consent note if webcams or uploads would be used.
- Prefer on‑device only demos; do not retain student images.

Printing
- Week 1 algorithm sheets; Week 2 paper‑prototype kit; Week 8/12 playtest and showcase checklists.
- Bell‑ringer QR cards and progress charts (optional).

Rubric (lightweight)
- Beginner: Can add a city/route in data; explain turn order.
- Developing: Implement card draw and claim with conditions.
- Proficient: Complete loop with scoring; clear UI; bug list addressed.
- Advanced: Added destination tickets or save/load; accessibility polish.
 - Advanced: Added destination tickets or save/load; accessibility polish.

Weekly backup (end of class)
- Teams click More (⋯) → Download (ZIP) on their sketch.
- Save to a shared class folder using the naming convention.
- If no shared drive, collect ZIPs to a teacher USB organized by section/week.
