## After‑School Intro to CS (4th–5th Grade)

This repo contains a 13‑week, hands‑on introductory computer science program designed for 4th–5th graders. Students build a simplified board game (inspired by Ticket to Ride) using JavaScript + p5.js, with an optional 2‑week mini‑unit on AI. The plan emphasizes concrete, developmentally appropriate activities and weekly playtesting.

### Highlights
- **Age‑appropriate**: Concrete‑first approach, unplugged activities, and visual programming transition.
- **Project‑based**: Students implement a small, playable board game.
- **Low‑friction tech**: p5.js via an OpenProcessing Class ([class link](https://openprocessing.org/class/101362#/)). Fallbacks: [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) or Python Turtle.
- **Typing bell‑ringer**: Quick, consistent keyboard practice at the start of each session.

## What’s Inside
- `syllabus-13-weeks.md`: Week‑by‑week plan, goals, and outcomes.
- `checklists-and-prep.md`: Setup, room logistics, pairing, pacing, assessment, and safety.
- `bell-ringer-typing.md`: Typing routine guide (Monkeytype settings, flow, fallbacks).
- `p5js-starter.md`: p5.js starter sketch with cities, routes, turns, and route claiming.
- `python-turtle-starter.md`: Trinket/Replit‑friendly Turtle starter with the same mechanics.
- `lesson-one-pager-template.md`: Fast‑fill weekly prep template.
- `project-description.md`: Program background and constraints.
- `initial-research.md`: Developmental framework and rationale.

## Getting Started (Teachers)
1. Review join and backup steps in `openprocessing-join-instructions.md`.
2. Open your OpenProcessing Class ([class link](https://openprocessing.org/class/101362#/)).
3. Create one starter sketch per pair (or have students create it), then paste the code from `p5js-starter.md` into `sketch.js` and press Run.
4. If OpenProcessing is blocked, use the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) or `python-turtle-starter.md` in Trinket/Replit.
5. Review `syllabus-13-weeks.md` and `checklists-and-prep.md` for the weekly flow.
6. Enable the typing bell‑ringer per `bell-ringer-typing.md` (allowlist sites in your network).

### Weekly Flow (60–75 min)
- 5 min: Typing bell‑ringer, then quick recap
- 10–15 min: Mini‑lesson + live demo
- 30–40 min: Pair programming build time
- 5–10 min: Playtest/share + exit ticket

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome. The maintainer will act as the gatekeeper for changes (protected main branch; PRs required). Please open an Issue to discuss significant ideas before submitting a PR.

### What Help Is Most Useful
- **Tailoring to Alabama 4th–5th grade topics**: Provide lesson variants that connect to Alabama public school standards (Digital Literacy & CS; and cross‑curricular tie‑ins in Math, Science, and Social Studies). Include:
  - The specific standard(s) or objective(s)
  - A short activity or modification (10–20 min) that ties the game project to the topic
  - Any handouts or slides (PDF preferred) and teacher notes
- **Cheat‑sheet printouts**: Single‑page references students can keep on desks or on the wall. Ideal topics:
  - p5.js drawing and input API (shapes, text, mouse)
  - Arrays/objects cheat sheet (JS basics for this project)
  - "Game loop" and state machine quick reference
  - Debugging checklist (what to try before asking for help)

### Contribution Guidelines
- Use Issues to propose: “Alignment: [Topic/Standard]” or “Cheat Sheet: [Subject]”.
- For PRs, prefer small, focused changes. Name your PRs clearly, e.g. `docs: add p5.js API cheat sheet` or `lesson: week-4 Alabama math tie-in`.
- For cheat sheets:
  - Submit both source (Google Doc/Slides link or editable format) and a final PDF.
  - Keep to one page; printer‑friendly (high contrast, minimal color dependence).
  - Include a footer with version and date.
- For lesson tie‑ins:
  - Add a short teacher note: objectives, materials, timing, differentiation.
  - Reference the exact Alabama standard text or code.
  - Provide any student‑facing handouts as PDFs.

## Governance
- Main branch is protected. All contributions go through PR review by the maintainer.
- The maintainer may request revisions to keep scope age‑appropriate and the project lightweight for school labs.

## Roadmap (High‑Level)
- More Alabama‑aligned mini‑activities (Math, Science, Social Studies connections)
- Accessibility pass for color/contrast and keyboard navigation
- Optional end‑of‑semester showcase kit (posters, scripts, invitations)
- Additional cheat sheets (variables & types, events, collisions, simple animations)

- Code samples (p5.js/Python): suggested MIT License.
